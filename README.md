# pdfCombiner
I made this script for automating a simple work task, which was taking a list of file identifiers from a google sheets doc
then search within a directory for those files (PDFs) and merge them into a single one.

I used to do it with online tools but most have some kind of restriction, for example pdfs quantity at a time,
so I made my own tool fitted to my needs.
