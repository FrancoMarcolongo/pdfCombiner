# pdfCombiner
I made this script for a cliente, it is used for automating a simple work task, which was taking a list of file identifiers 
from a google sheets doc then search within a directory for those files (PDFs) and merge them into a single one.

It was prevously done with online tools, looking manually for the files, uploading them to an online tool to 
combine them into one pdf file. With this script it is automatized and suited to the client needs.
